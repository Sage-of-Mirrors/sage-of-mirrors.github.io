					SuperBMD is a C# program that allows the user to work with BMD and BDL, the 3D model format that Nintendo used throughout the GameCube and Wii eras.
					It provides both importing and exporting functions, allowing the user to import skinned 3D meshes into GameCube and Wii games, and export skinned meshes
					to formats that are supported by common 3D modeling programs. Below are some examples of 3D models produced by SuperBMD.

				<p>GitHub Repositories: <a href="https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/libgbacom">https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/libgbacom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/PC-TCG">https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/PC-TCG</a></p><br>
				<p>Libgbacom is a C++ library that allows any program to communicate with the GameBoy Advance emulator VBA-M. Based on the GameCube emulator Dolphin's implementation,
				libgbacom uses SFML's networking functionality to speak with the emulator over the network. It is intended to be used by PC-TCG, which is a project that aims to restore
				GBA functionality to the PC port of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. The game, originally released on the GameCube, had special GBA connectivity that was removed during the port.
				The project restores most of the original connectivity menus and will allow the game to communicate with VBA-M as if it were a GameCube.</p>
