					My name's Dylan Ascencio. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a penchant for game development. I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin - Stout, majoring in
					Computer Science - Game Design with an anticipated graduation date of May 2020.

					Winditor is a multi-purpose editor for the 2003 GameCube game <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>. The suite includes editors for maps, collision, text, drop items, and more.
					The project has been an ongoing effort by multiple people for several years, and the current iteration was led by Matt "LordNed" Hoffman and I.

				</div>
				<p>
					With Winditor's text editor, the user can modify the properties and contents of any message in the game. Addition of new messages is permitted, but removal is not; many objects in <em>The Wind Waker</em>
					reference messages based on index rather than their unique IDs, which means that removing messages will break those objects by changing where the messages are located in the file. When messages are added,
					the editor will check the existing messages to ensure that the new ones have their own unique IDs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The raw text data in <em>The Wind Waker</em> contains binary control codes, which tell the game engine to insert variables into the text or modify how it is drawn. To make it easy to
					work with these, they are converted into control tags contained within square brackets. For example, [red] will change the text color to red, while [white] reverts it to white. The [player] tag inserts the
					player's name into the text. Whenever the text changes, the editor validates any control tags that it finds. If invalid tags are found, an error is displayed as shown below:

					SuperBMD is a C# program that allows the user to work with BMD and BDL, the 3D model format that Nintendo used throughout the GameCube and Wii eras.
					It provides both importing and exporting functions, allowing the user to import skinned 3D meshes into GameCube and Wii games, and export skinned meshes
					to formats that are supported by common 3D modeling programs. Below are some examples of 3D models produced by SuperBMD.

				<!-- Faura -->
				<h3 class="title has-text-grey-lighter">Faura</h3>
				<p><b>GitHub Repository:</b> <a href="https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Faura">https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Faura</a></p><br>
				<p>
					Faura is a C# tool for compiling and decompiling event scripts for games developed for the PlayStation 2 by Gust. It is specifically designed for the 2007
					<em>Ar Tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica</em>, but it is extensible such that it can be modified to work with Gust's other games. The tool's name comes from
					a constructed language used in the <em>Ar Tonelico</em> series called Hymmnos, where it means "small bird."
				</p><br>
				<p>
					The event binaries are made up of two pieces: text data and script commands. When Faura decompiles an even file, it produces a JSON file containing the text data and 
					an ASM-styled text file representing the script commands. A typical text entry looks like this:
				</p><br>
				<div class="box">
<pre>
{
  "Name": "msg_25",
  "IsUsed": "True",
  "TextboxType": "FULLPORTRAIT",
  "CharacterName": "SPICA",
  "CharacterID": "595",
  "PortraitPosition": "LEFT_CONVERSATION",
  "Text": "...even when everything was perfect."
},
</pre>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					While the ASM-style script data looks like this:
				</p><br>
								<div class="box">
<pre>

</pre>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Here, each line represents a single function call by the event. Each function lists its arguments. The functions are typically executed in a linear order; however,
					there are some control structures in place with the <code>BeginBlock</code> and <code>GoToBlock</code> functions. These allow the event to proceed differently
					based on various conditions, and they can even create loops that repeat actions until a condition is met or let the player confirm menu choices.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					Below is a video of a custom event that I wrote once Faura was advanced enough. It adapts part of a light novel based on <em>Ar Tonelico II</em>, and demonstrates
					much of what the event system of that game can do - character movement, emotion bubbles, conversation portraits, and so on.

				<p>
					Libgbacom is a C++ library that allows any program to communicate with the GameBoy Advance emulator VBA-M. Based on the GameCube emulator Dolphin's implementation,
					libgbacom uses SFML's networking functionality to speak with the emulator over the network. It is intended to be used by PC-TCG, which is a project that aims to restore
					GBA functionality to the PC port of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. The game, originally released on the GameCube, had special GBA connectivity that was removed during the port.
					The project restores most of the original connectivity menus and will allow the game to communicate with VBA-M as if it were a GameCube.
